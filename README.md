# RESTful API
I personally used the Eclipse IDE because it is free and widely used.
It is also updated often.
Once the repository has been extracted, do the following.
Using Eclipse, go to File->Import...-> Drop down the General folder->Existing Projects into Workspace
Click Next >
On the line Select root directory: Click Browse... and select the folder where you extracted this repository
Select Finish
The project should load at this point.
Clicking run at the top should properly generate and provide text in the console for my example.
Feel free to play around and mess with my methods and variables!
